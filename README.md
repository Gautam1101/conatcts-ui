Design Decisions and Application Structure
- Technology Stack:
  - Angular: Chosen for its comprehensive framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) with a rich feature set.
  - Angular CLI: Used for development, build, and deployment processes.

- Application Structure:
  - Components: Reusable Angular components that encapsulate different parts of the UI.
  - Modules:  Angular modules that group related components, services, and other code for better organization.
  - Services: Contains logic for interacting with the Contacts API, typically using Angular's HttpClient.
  - Routing: Angular Router is used for navigating between different views of the application.

- Design Decisions:
  - Component-Based Architecture: Encourages reuse and separation of concerns, which helps in managing and scaling the application.
  - Reactive Forms: Used for handling form inputs and validations in a reactive manner.
  - Modular Design: Promotes a clean and organized structure by breaking the application into modules and components.
